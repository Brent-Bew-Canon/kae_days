                <p class="med-p">Hey there, welcome to the world of EMDR therapy! If you're wondering what that is,
                    don't worry,
                    you're not alone. EMDR stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, and it's a type of
                    psychotherapy that's gaining popularity due to its effectiveness in treating a variety of mental
                    health issues.</p>
                <h2 class="pt-3 pb-3">So, what exactly is EMDR therapy and how does it work?</h2>
                <p class="med-p">EMDR therapy was developed in the late 1980s by psychologist Francine Shapiro. It's
                    based on the idea
                    that traumatic or distressing experiences can get stuck in our brains, causing us to relive the same
                    emotions, sensations, and thoughts over and over again. This can lead to conditions like
                    post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
                    <br><br>
                    EMDR therapy involves several phases, including the initial assessment, developing a treatment plan,
                    and reprocessing the traumatic memories through guided eye movements or other forms of bilateral
                    stimulation (BLS). BLS can include tapping, sound, or vibration, and is used to help the brain
                    process and integrate the difficult memories.
                </p>
                <h2 class="pt-3 pb-3">What do I use in session?</h2>
                <p class="med-p">The form of BLS that I prefer to use in sessions involves 2 gentle buzzers that the
                    client holds in
                    each hand. These buzzers alternate with soft vibrations to stimulate each side of the brain while
                    the client is guided through the traumatic memories to process them.
                    <br><br>
                    The exact reasons for why BLS works in EMDR therapy is not fully understood. However, it is thought
                    that the rhythmic bilateral stimulation can help to stimulate the brain's natural processing and
                    integration mechanisms. This can help the brain to reprocess and integrate the traumatic memories,
                    which can lead to a reduction in symptoms.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, you might be thinking, “Sitting in a therapy office holding buzzers sounds kind of weird." But
                    trust me, it's not as strange as it sounds. During an EMDR session, you'll be asked to focus on a
                    specific traumatic memory or feeling while simultaneously feeling the buzzers alternate in each
                    hand. This might sound odd, but it's actually a form of guided meditation that helps your brain
                    reprocess the memory in a more adaptive way.
                </p>
                <h2 class="pt-3 pb-3">Why trust me to do EMDR?</h2>
                <p class="med-p">EMDR therapy should only be conducted by a trained therapist who has completed
                    specialized training
                    in the technique. As a trained EMDR therapist, I have the skills to guide you through these
                    tremendously difficult memories and emotions and help you heal.
                    <br><br>
                    EMDR is an evidence-based practice that is proven to show results much faster than other traditional
                    forms of therapy. Clients can see results in as little as 1 – 2 sessions!
                    <br><br>
