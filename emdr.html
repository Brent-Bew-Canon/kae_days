                        don't worry, you're not alone. EMDR stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing,
                        and it's a type of psychotherapy that's gaining popularity due to its effectiveness in treating
                        a variety of mental health issues.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5">EMDR therapy was developed in the late 1980s by psychologist Francine Shapiro. It's
                        based on the idea that traumatic or distressing experiences can get stuck in our brains, causing
                        us to relive the same emotions, sensations, and thoughts over and over again. This can lead to
                        conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and other mental
                        health issues.
                        <br><br>
                        EMDR therapy involves several phases, including the initial assessment, developing a treatment
                        plan, and reprocessing the traumatic memories through guided eye movements or other forms of
                        bilateral stimulation (BLS). BLS can include tapping, sound, or vibration, and is used to help
                        the brain process and integrate the difficult memories.

        <div class="container mt-5">
            <div class="row  justify-content-center rounded">
                <div class="col-8">
                    <p class="fs-5">The form of BLS that I prefer to use in sessions involves 2 gentle buzzers that the
                        client holds in each hand. These buzzers alternate with soft vibrations to stimulate each side
                        of the brain while the client is guided through the traumatic memories to process them.
                        <br><br>
                        The exact reasons for why BLS works in EMDR therapy is not fully understood. However, it is
                        thought that the rhythmic bilateral stimulation can help to stimulate the brain's natural
                        processing and integration mechanisms. This can help the brain to reprocess and integrate the
                        traumatic memories, which can lead to a reduction in symptoms.
                        <br><br>
                        Now, you might be thinking, “Sitting in a therapy office holding buzzers sounds kind of weird."
                        But trust me, it's not as strange as it sounds. During an EMDR session, you'll be asked to focus
                        on a specific traumatic memory or feeling while simultaneously feeling the buzzers alternate in
                        each hand. This might sound odd, but it's actually a form of guided meditation that helps your
                        brain reprocess the memory in a more adaptive way.

                        EMDR is an evidence-based practice that is proven to show results much faster than other
                        traditional forms of therapy. Clients can see results in as little as 1 – 2 sessions!
